Unlike Flash Builder, Flash Professional does not natively support FlexUnit.  As such, it is necessary to build a little test application of sorts.

The test application loads classes from the actual application (through the other application exporting a .swc file) and then tests them.

The basic idea behind setting up the test appliation is:

- Download http://flexunit.org/releases/flexunit-4.1.0-8-4.1.0.16076.zip
- Extract it somewhere (the file of interest is flexunit-4.1.0-8-as3_4.1.0.16076.swc)

- Open the project in Flash
- If prompted, choose to pick a new project root. Choose the testing folder (the folder this file is in) as the root.
- Open the fla file and make sure it is in focus
- Go to File -> Publish Settings
- Go to the Flash tab, and then click on Settings next to the "Script" drop down.
- Click on the library tab
- Click the plus button to add a new entry
- Click on the red "Browse to SWC" button
- Add the flexunit swc (flexunit-4.1.0-8-as3_4.1.0.16076.swc)
